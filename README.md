# Visiting Porto, Portugal

With a 2008 population of 221,000, Porto is located in the north west part of Portugal and is its second largest city. Porto is known as the financial, economic and cultural heart of the entire northern Portugal region.

[Oporto](https://concrete-everything.com/) is perhaps most famous for Port wine, which is produced and shipped from this area. There are about 60 wine establishments in the city area, and you can easily find tours and tastings.

The center of town has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as there are many old architectural wonders. The area is best explored by foot, starting with the Cathedral of Porto which was constructed between 1110 and completed in the following century. It is considered to be one of the most important Romanesque monuments in Portugal. Another Romanesque structure of note is the small Church of Cedofeita, built between the 12th and 13th centuries. The neoclassical 19th-century Stock Exchange Palace is also a marvelous structure where you can get a guided tour. Right next door sits the Church of St. Francis, which was built originally in 1383 and added to until its completion in 1425. It is considered the finest Gothic structure in Porto.

Porto features a tangle of charming winding lanes that work steeply down to the waterfront. Along the way, many of the oldest buildings in the city are crumbling and are in fact at risk of collapsing. Down by the waterfront there is a markedly medieval look and feel, and the riverside has an old world enchantment with archways, alleyways and lively atmosphere.

There are several culinary specialties in Porto, most notably Tripes Porto Style, otherwise known as tripe soup, and the Francesinha, the most famous popular snack food which is a special sandwich with several different meats and cheese and a beer sauce. Try it! And by all means have some Port wine.
